# AP_PROG Machine Learning Assignment
Created for the evaluated assignment of the AP_PROG Machine Learning course at AgroParisTech given by Mr. Vincent GUIGUE. The details of the asisgnment are given [here](https://github.com/vguigue/tuto_sklearn) (in french). 

In the present repository you will find the html rendered versions of my notebooks for the Classification task I decided to investigate and another for the Regression task I chose. I also made available the actual notebooks for anyone wanting to play with the data and further investigate the problem themselves. **Note that these notebooks take quit some time to run and they produce big intermediary files so you may not want to run them if you do not have time / sufficient memory available.**

### Classification task : Predicting tissue of extraction of B cells.
The goal is to use single-cell RNAseq profiles to predict the tissue from which each B cell was extracted. In the dataset I chose, we have 9 heavily unbalanced classes which we try to predict. I found the dataset on the awesome [Tabula Sapiens Database](https://tabula-sapiens.sf.czbiohub.org/). 

### Regression task : Predicting Life expectancy.
For this problem, the task was to be able to accurately predict Life expectancy based on health and economy factors. The dataset can be found [here on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who).
